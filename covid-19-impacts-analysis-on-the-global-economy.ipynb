The crisis led to a dramatic increase in inequality within and across countries. Preliminary evidence suggests that the recovery from the crisis will be as uneven as its initial economic impacts, with emerging economies and economically disadvantaged groups needing much more time to recover pandemic-induced losses of income and livelihoods.\n","\n","- The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment, and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, you are required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.\n","\n","- In contrast to many earlier crises, the onset of the pandemic was met with a large, decisive economic policy response that was generally successful in mitigating its worst human costs in the short run. However, the emergency response also created new risks—such as dramatically increased levels of private and public debt in the world economy—that may threaten an equitable recovery from the crisis if they are not addressed decisively.\n","\n","#### Paper: [The economic impacts of the COVID-19
