The crisis led to a dramatic increase in inequality within and across countries. Preliminary evidence suggests that the recovery from the crisis will be as uneven as its initial economic impacts, with emerging economies and economically disadvantaged groups needing much more time to recover pandemic-induced losses of income and livelihoods.\n","\n","- The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment, and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, you are required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.\n","\n","- In contrast to many earlier crises, the onset of the pandemic was met with a large, decisive economic policy response that was generally successful in mitigating its worst human costs in the short run. However, the emergency response also created new risks—such as dramatically increased levels of private and public debt in the world economy—that may threaten an equitable recovery from the crisis if they are not addressed decisively.\n","\n","#### Paper: [The economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2022/brief/chapter-1-introduction-the-economic-impacts-of-the-covid-19-crisis)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6acba0b0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.00536,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:30.714263","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:30.708903","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Import Libraries"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"ba4189b6","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-24T19:02:30.728689Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-24T19:02:30.72764Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.775615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.773947Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.058707,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.778667","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:30.71996","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import plotly.express as px\n","import plotly.graph_objects as go"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"5f03a29e","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005493,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.790056","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.784563","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Read Data"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"id":"6cd053a7","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.803445Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.802969Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.144216Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.142903Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.351617,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.147393","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:32.795776","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/impact-of-covid19-pandemic-on-the-global-economy/transformed_data.csv\")\n","data2 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/impact-of-covid19-pandemic-on-the-global-economy/raw_data.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"id":"ff28f28c","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.160745Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.160327Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.180893Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.179548Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.031021,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.184183","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.153162","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["      CODE      COUNTRY        DATE    HDI        TC        TD       STI  \\\n","0      AFG  Afghanistan  2019-12-31  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n","1      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-01  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n","2      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-02  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n","3      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-03  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n","4      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-04  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n","...    ...          ...         ...    ...       ...       ...       ...   \n","50413  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-15  0.535  8.994048  5.442418  4.341855   \n","50414  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-16  0.535  8.996528  5.442418  4.341855   \n","50415  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-17  0.535  8.999496  5.442418  4.341855   \n","50416  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-18  0.535  9.000853  5.442418  4.341855   \n","50417  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-19  0.535  9.005405  5.442418  4.341855   \n","\n","             POP    GDPCAP  \n","0      17.477233  7.497754  \n","1      17.477233  7.497754  \n","2      17.477233  7.497754  \n","3      17.477233  7.497754  \n","4      17.477233  7.497754  \n","...          ...       ...  \n","50413  16.514381  7.549491  \n","50414  16.514381  7.549491  \n","50415  16.514381  7.549491  \n","50416  16.514381  7.549491  \n","50417  16.514381  7.549491  \n","\n","[50418 rows x 9 columns]\n"]}],"source":["print(data)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"7eec09b7","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005557,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.195591","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.190034","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["#### The data we are using contains the data on covid-19 cases and their impact on GDP from December 31, 2019, to October 10, 2020."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"ddc14031","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005581,"end_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.207483","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-04-24T19:02:33.201902","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# Data Preparation\n","\n","- The dataset that we are using here contains two data files.
