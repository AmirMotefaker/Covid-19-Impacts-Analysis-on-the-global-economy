Global poverty increased for the first time in a generation, and disproportionate income losses among disadvantaged populations led to a dramatic rise in inequality within and across countries.\n\n- The outbreak of Covid-19 resulted in a lot of restrictions which resulted in so many impacts on the global economy. Almost all countries were impacted negatively by the rise in the cases of Covid-19.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Covid-19 Impacts Analysis\n\n- The COVID-19 pandemic sent shock waves through the world economy and triggered the largest global economic crisis in more than a century. The crisis led to a dramatic increase in inequality within and across countries. Preliminary evidence suggests that the recovery from the crisis will be as uneven as its initial economic impacts, with emerging economies and economically disadvantaged groups needing much more time to recover pandemic-induced losses of income and livelihoods.\n\n- The first wave of covid-19 impacted the global economy as the world was never ready for the pandemic. It resulted in a rise in cases, a rise in deaths, a rise in unemployment, and a rise in poverty, resulting in an economic slowdown. Here, you are required to analyze the spread of Covid-19 cases and all the impacts of covid-19 on the economy.\n\n- In contrast to many earlier crises, the onset of the pandemic was met with a large, decisive economic policy response that was generally successful in mitigating its worst human costs in the short run. However, the emergency response also created new risks—such as dramatically increased levels of private and public debt in the world economy—that may threaten an equitable recovery from the crisis if they are not addressed decisively.\n\n#### Paper: [The economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis](https://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2022/brief/chapter-1-introduction-the-economic-impacts-of-the-covid-19-crisis)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import Libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-22T10:54:07.146063Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-22T10:54:07.146693Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-22T10:54:09.810783Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-22T10:54:07.146657Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-22T10:54:09.809354Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/impact-of-covid19-pandemic-on-the-global-economy/transformed_data.csv\")\ndata2 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/impact-of-covid19-pandemic-on-the-global-economy/raw_data.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-22T10:54:09.812926Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-22T10:54:09.813377Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.243538Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-22T10:54:09.813342Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.242039Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(data)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.245467Z","iopub.execute_input":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.245998Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.268798Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.245936Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-04-22T10:54:10.267888Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"      CODE      COUNTRY        DATE    HDI        TC        TD       STI  \\\n0      AFG  Afghanistan  2019-12-31  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n1      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-01  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n2      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-02  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n3      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-03  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n4      AFG  Afghanistan  2020-01-04  0.498  0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   \n...    ...          ...         ...    ...       ...       ...       ...   \n50413  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-15  0.535  8.994048  5.442418  4.341855   \n50414  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-16  0.535  8.996528  5.442418  4.341855   \n50415  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-17  0.535  8.999496  5.442418  4.341855   \n50416  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-18  0.535  9.000853  5.442418  4.341855   \n50417  ZWE     Zimbabwe  2020-10-19  0.535  9.005405  5.442418  4.341855   \n\n             POP    GDPCAP  \n0      17.477233  7.497754  \n1      17.477233  7.497754  \n2      17.477233  7.497754  \n3      17.477233  7.497754  \n4      17.477233  7.497754  \n...          ...       ...  \n50413  16.514381  7.549491  \n50414  16.514381  7.549491  \n50415  16.514381  7.549491  \n50416  16.514381  7.549491  \n50417  16.514381  7.549491  \n\n[50418 rows x 9 columns]\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The data we are using contains the data on covid-19 cases and their impact on GDP from December 31, 2019, to October 10, 2020.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Preparation\n\n- The dataset that we are using here contains two data files.
